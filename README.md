# Credit Card Approval (Under development)
Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/data

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is a 'good' or 'bad' client, were the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. Thus, we need to find a way to construct the labels. Lastly, imbalance data problem is a big problem in this project, which also needs to be handle.

The project contains the *CreditCardApproval.ipynb* notebook, which takes a look at the provided datasets as well as preprocessing of the datasets, where the constructing of the labels also happens. In addition to that, an exploratory data analysis is made to provide a better understanding of the dataset. Lastly, the dataset is spilted and made ready to be used for training.
